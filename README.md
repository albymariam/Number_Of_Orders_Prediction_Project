E-Commerce Order Demand Forecasting

Overview:
This project predicts future customer order demand for an e-commerce platform using historical sales, pricing, marketing, and seasonality data.
It helps in inventory planning, demand estimation, and business decision-making.

Features:
-> Data preprocessing & feature engineering
->Lag and moving-average time series features
->Multiple regression models for comparison
->Next-day and 7-day order forecasting
->Trend and seasonality visualizations

Tech Stack:
Language: Python 
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, XGBoost 
Tools: VS Code, Jupyter Notebook, Git, GitHub 

Models Used:
Linear Regression  
Random Forest Regressor  
XGBoost Regressor  
Evaluation Metrics: RMSE, MAE, R²

Forecasting:
->Predicts next-day orders for selected products
->Generates 7-day demand forecasts using historical patterns


Note: This project uses a synthetic/simulated dataset created to reflect realistic e-commerce demand patterns.
Run the notebook/script after placing the dataset in the project folder.
